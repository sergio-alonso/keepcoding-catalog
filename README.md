# keepcoding-prototype - Responsive Front-End Prototype

To get the job done, we need a solid foundation, and best practices by default.

## Code Reuse

## Rapid Prototyping

- Idea: requirements
- Sketch: paper
- Wirefrime: [Balsamiq](http://mybalsamiq.com)
- Prototype: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 

## Start development environment

```bash
git clone 
npm install
npm start
```

Now you can go to [http://localhost:3000/]() with your web browser.
Or [http://localhost:3000/api/db]() to access database through API.


## Get a list of the avaliable commands to run

```bash
npm run
```

# Gallery
Masonry layout grid and lightbox modal
This layout mode allows placing image thumbnails in optimal, responsive grid, so your gallery will look like a stone wall, where gallery items will be stones. Also there is a slider lightbox popup for viewing them.
