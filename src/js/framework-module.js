/*
 * Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture by Nicholas C.Zakas

 */

/*
 * Module
 *
 * Independent unit of functionality that is part of the total
 * structure of a web application.

 */

/*
 * Each module has its own sandbox.
 * An interface with which the module can interact to ensue loose coupling.
 *
 * Modules have limited knowledge.
 * Each module knows about their sandbox and that's it.
 *
 * Each module's job is to create a meaningful user experience.
